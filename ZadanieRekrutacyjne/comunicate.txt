Ivy Bridge is the codename for the "third generation" of the Intel Core processors (Core i7, i5, i3). Ivy Bridge is a die shrink to 22 nanometer manufacturing process based on the 32 nanometer Sandy Bridge ("second generation" of Intel Core)—see tick–tock model. 
The name is also applied more broadly to the 22 nm die shrink of the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture based on FinFET ("3D") Tri-Gate transistors, which is also used in the Xeon and Core i7 Ivy Bridge-EX (Ivytown), Ivy Bridge-EP and Ivy Bridge-E microprocessors released in 2013.

Ivy Bridge processors are backward compatible with the Sandy Bridge platform, but such systems might require a firmware update (vendor specific).[2] In 2011, Intel released the 7-series Panther Point chipsets with integrated USB 3.0 and SATA 3.0 to complement Ivy Bridge.[3]

Volume production of Ivy Bridge chips began in the third quarter of 2011.[4] Quad-core and dual-core-mobile models launched on April 29, 2012 and May 31, 2012 respectively.[5] Core i3 desktop proc
